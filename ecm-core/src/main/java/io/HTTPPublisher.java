	 * Create a new HTTP publisher that will arrange to publish keys and their

	 * characters straight before the first : sign, can be subject to sugaring
	 * using the + sign as a separator. For example, a URL starting with
	 * <code>https+put://</code> will be understood as an HTTP PUT operation
	 * performed within an SSL protected HTTP connection.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * Apart from <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>, the following
	 * sugaring keywords are recognised:
	 * <dl>
	 * <dt>get</dt>
	 * <dd>HTTP GET operation, the default, template is ignored</dd>
	 * <dt>put</dt>
	 * <dd>HTTP PUT operation</dd>
	 * <dt>post</dt>
	 * <dd>HTTP POST operation</dd>
	 * <dt>delete</dt>
	 * <dd>HTTP DELETE operation, template is ignored</dd>
	 * <dt>del</dt>
	 * <dd>HTTP DELETE operation, template is ignored</dd>
	 * <dt>ssl</dt>
	 * <dd>Same as specifying <code>https</code></dd>
	 * </dl>
	 * 
	 * In addition, both the location and the template can be object of another
	 * type of sugaring. Strings enclosed by %-signs will be replaced by the
	 * value of the key or the value as follows: <code>%key%</code> will be
	 * replaced by the name of the key. <code>%value%</code> will be replaced by
	 * the value of the key and any string matching the name of the key enclosed
	 * by <code>%</code> signs will be replaced by the value of the key.
	 * 
	 * @param location
	 *            URL at which to perform the HTTP operation, see above for all
	 *            sugaring possibilities.
	 * @param template
	 *            Data to push as part of the HTTP operation, this will
	 *            typically only be used for PUT or POST operations.
