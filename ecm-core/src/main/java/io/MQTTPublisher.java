	 * Creates an MQTT publisher that will arrange to publish keys and their
	 * values whenever necessary. The scheme of the URL, in other words, the
	 * characters straight before the first : sign, can be subject to sugaring
	 * using the + sign as a separator. For example, a URL starting with
	 * <code>mqtt+ssl://</code> will be understood as an MQTT connection secured
	 * using the SSL protocol.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * Apart from <code>mqtt</code> and <code>mqtts</code>, the following
	 * sugaring keywords are recognised:
	 * <dl>
	 * <dt>clean</dt>
	 * <dd>Force a clean session at connection time, the default is as per the
	 * Paho default.</dd>
	 * <dt>unclean</dt>
	 * <dd>Force an unclean session at connection time, the default is as per
	 * the Paho default.</dd>
	 * <dt>retain</dt>
	 * <dd>Messages will be requested to be retained at server.</dd>
	 * <dt>qos0</dt>
	 * <dd>Force QoS 0</dd>
	 * <dt>qos1</dt>
	 * <dd>Force QoS 1</dd>
	 * <dt>qos2</dt>
	 * <dd>Force QoS 2</dd>
	 * <dt>ssl</dt>
	 * <dd>Same as specifying <code>mqtts</code></dd>
	 * </dl>
	 * 
	 * The server and port part of the URL can also contain a username and
	 * password specification, details that will be provided when opening the
	 * connection to the MQTT server. These should be represented as a
	 * colon-separated pair, prepended to the server and port specification and
	 * separated from that specification by an @ sign.
	 * 
	 * In addition, both the location and the template can be object of another
	 * type of sugaring. Strings enclosed by %-signs will be replaced by the
	 * value of the key or the value as follows: <code>%key%</code> will be
	 * replaced by the name of the key. <code>%value%</code> will be replaced by
	 * the value of the key and any string matching the name of the key enclosed
	 * by <code>%</code> signs will be replaced by the value of the key.
	 * 
	 * @param uniqueId
	 *            Unique identifier identifying the MQTT client.
	 * @param location
	 *            URL at which to perform the HTTP operation, see above for all
	 *            sugaring possibilities.
	 * @param template
	 *            Data to push as part of the HTTP operation, this will
	 *            typically only be used for PUT or POST operations.
