It's a good thing to push your changes to the active git branch. We had some
problem were uncommitted changes remained over night and another member had
made changes to that branch resulting in a lot of merge error.

Also make sure to inform team members when making changes so that they are aware
and are given an opportunity to react accordingly.

Other than that we have had a successful sprint. The only thing we were not able
to complete this sprint was having a working ALC. However it is in the test
phase which means all that is left is make sure it works properly with given
circumstances. We have managed to "perfect" our ACC and started working on
draft for the final Reflection Report. It feels like we are on good track
to complete the task given to us.

We were happy with the User Stories we created this week. The different
programming on the moped doesn't require as many people and thus we have
reallocated some people to work on the finishing report. We expect this to
continue next sprint progressively until, after the demo, everyone is will
collaborate on it.
